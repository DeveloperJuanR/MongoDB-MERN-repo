# MERN Stack Employee Database

This project is a **full-stack MERN application** for managing an employee database. It was developed by following the official MongoDB tutorial and is intended to help with learning and exploring the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

### Project Overview
The application provides a simple interface to create, read, update, and delete employee records, allowing users to manage employee data within a MongoDB database. The project leverages the latest tools and technologies available in the MERN stack.

### What I Learned
- **MongoDB**: Setting up and connecting to MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database storage.
- **Express**: Building a server with Express to handle API routes for managing employee data.
- **React**: Building a front-end with React.js for rendering and interacting with the employee database.
- **Node.js**: Integrating the backend server with Node.js for handling requests.

### Important Notes
- The project was created **following the MongoDB tutorial** on how to build a MERN stack application.
- I did not create this application from scratch; rather, I coded it out as part of my learning journey to gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack.
- The tutorial is available on MongoDB's official website, and I encourage you to check it out for a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have:
- A **MongoDB Atlas** account (for the database)
- Basic understanding of **Node.js** and **React.js**

### Installation
1. Must have Node.js and MongoDB Atlas installed on your machine. 
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeveloperJuanR/MongoDB-MERN-repo.git
3. Must reinstall node_modules folder, in /server .
4. Must recreate config.env file, with your own MongoDB connection string EX:
   
    ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.<projectId>.mongodb.net/employeesretryWrites=true&w=majority
   
    PORT=5050
